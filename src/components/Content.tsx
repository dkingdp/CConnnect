                        At C-connect, we offer our services through a case
                        management approach. It's important to note that we are
                        not a law firm, and while our consultations are
                        valuable, they should not be considered a replacement
                        for legal advice from a qualified attorney.
                        Additionally, our organization is independent and not
                        associated with any government entity. Our primary focus
                        is on providing advocacy and case management support for
                        immigrants. Our dedicated case managers assist
                        undocumented immigrants by providing orientation within
                        the legal system and aiding in the completion of
                        residency applications. For documented immigrants, our
                        services include planning for work visas and citizenship
                        tests, conducting thorough assessments of both home and
                        work environments, and facilitating access to various
                        social services.
